# PREVENTION OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH AFTER MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION BY DEFIBRILLATOR IMPLANTATION

The ambition of PROFID is to reassess the role of routine prophylactic ICD implantation in patients with reduced LVEF ≤ 35% after myocardial infarction under contemporary OMT and fundamentally improve clinical practice, potentially resulting in a substantial reduction of the enormous burden that sudden cardiac death places on society as a whole and on the individual patient.

PROFID is expected to change SCD prevention in clinical practice. In order to reach the final goal, the following main phases have been designed for the PROFID project:

**Data analysis**
In the first phase, a variety of data from different settings will be analysed. The analysis will be based on a collection of existing highly phenotyped data with the largest number of post- myocardial infarction patients ever in this regard (~200,000 patients of both sexes).The databases represent a wide variety of data sources such as national registries, institutional research databases, electronic health records and claims databases. This repository contains code used to conduct a range of cohort studies within the PROFID data lake, to be submitted for publication in 2026.

**Clinical trial**
In the second phase, a non-inferiority randomised clinical trial will compare OMT versus ICD implantation plus OMT in post-MI patients with LVEF ≤ 35% who would receive an ICD according to current clinical guidelines.

The ultimate goal is to successfully prevent the majority of the catastrophic sudden cardiac death events that occur after myocardial infarction.

Thus, PROFID aims to close the huge gap of current clinical practice with regard to protection from sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction.

Usage examples.

For a project-wide, metadata-only overview of available variables and approximate observation counts across raw/source/CDM datasets and substudy groups, run the data structure inventory described in [Repo-Structure.md](Repo-Structure.md). On the HPC, the standard command is:

```bash
cd /sc-projects/sc-proj-dhzc-profid/PROFID_Substudies
PROFID_REPO_ROOT="$PWD" sbatch tools/run_profid_data_structure_inventory.sh
```

The inventory output is written to `/sc-projects/sc-proj-dhzc-profid/PROFID_Substudies/data/derived/data_structure/` and contains aggregate structure and availability metadata only, not individual patient data.
